- Relational DBS(sqlite,postgresql,coackroachdb ....) tables. -> type of database you go for (rows,tables,columns)
- Non Relation DBS(couchdb,MongoDB,nedb ....) collection -> documents -> JSON -> By you hardware specification

Non Relation->Draw Back
-Relationships ->mongoose ->difficult to create and manage relationships
-Better for bigger data ->Mongo (extremely huge)->hardware
-Better for readding bigger data ->
-Speed \*

//columns
)
