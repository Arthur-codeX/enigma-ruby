# How Does The Internet Work ?

-> Interconnection of computers that communicate with each other.
-> LAN(Local Area Network) -> Global Network ->
->Vast network of interconnected computes and devios(IOT) g;pba;u/
-> It Allows the exchange of information and communtion based on a set protacals IPS(Internet Prota Suites)

-> Devices(IOT) And Computers
-> Data Packets: Information is broken down into smaller units -> data packets -> infor and source destination
-> Routing -> How the data packets travel accross the networks ->routes
-> Protocal -> TCP(HTTP,HTTPS,FTP) ,UDP(WebRtc,VOIP),IP ->Dertaminse how the packets Travel
-> ISP (Internet Service Provide) -> PRovides aces to internet -> Safaricom gsm,artiel gsm ->
-> DNS (Domain Server System) ->Local IP ->Public IP(In the world) -> hostname -I
Directory eg phone book->name -> number
->Encryption and Security ->SSL -> SSH ->HTTPS ->HTTP

# What is a server ?. and how it works.

->A server is a Computer that serves and responds to requests from other Computers or devices over a network.
-> It can be server -> plex (media server)

# Servers that you have a created up to this point.
React HTTP (PROTAL->TCP)-> 3000
JSON HTTP -> 3000
Sinatrat HTTP -> 
ip->localhost->port
->server is listening for connections
->server will listen on a port and handle the request from that port

# API(APlication Programming Interface) ->HTTP || HTTPS || INTERACE FOR OBSUTRACTION
->  A layer of obstruction for communication->set of rules and protocols to allow different software applications
to communicate

-> Developing an App -> React Native -> Bluetooth -> API

# REST (REpresentation State Transfer) API-> JSON SERVER() ->HTTP || HTTPS 
-> Come up with rules that enabled people using (JS,RUBY,PYTHONS)
Kind Make our server that use api easy->
-> Mechanical system ->stand bolts ->m5 ->philips Head screw -> allen Head
-> HTTP METHODS ->(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH)
////->DB(CRUD) ->WHERE DOES THESE METHODS MAP TP
////->CRUD(CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE)
////->GET REQUEST => READ in THE DB
////->POST REQUEST => CREATE IN THE DB
////->PUT REQUEST =>UPDATE IN THE DB
////->DELETE REQUEST => DELETE

-> Authentication
Basic, Session, JWT
->SEND FILES WITH REST API
->URI(Uniform Resource Identifier)

facrbook.com ->192.234.54645 ->Server Singarpore
facrbook.com  -> 182.435.675

# HTTP STATUS CODES ->
100-199 -> INFORMATION STATUS CODES
200-299 -> SUCCESS STATUS CODES
          201->CREATED 
          204 -> NO DATA WAS RETURNED THE REQUEST IS OKAY(DELETE)
300-399 -> REDIRECT STATUS CODES
